"""Deterministic post-query maths layer.

SQL aggregates (SUM/COUNT/AVG) run inside SQLite's exact arithmetic engine and
are trusted. But a *derived* figure — a percentage, a share of a total, a
growth rate, a profit margin, an average-per-unit ratio — is where a small
model goes wrong, whether it tries to hand-write the division in SQL or
(worse) just states a number in its answer prose. This module recognises
those question shapes from the raw component numbers already in the result
rows and computes the derived value itself, in plain Python float arithmetic.

When it fires, its ready-made sentence is used verbatim and the LLM
answer-phrasing call is skipped entirely for that turn — there is no point in
the loop where the model gets a chance to recompute (and possibly mangle) a
number this layer has already worked out exactly.
